# ✅ Network Error Fixed - Voice Interface

## Status: FIXED and OPERATIONAL

The "network" error has been resolved by switching to the **WebSocket-based voice interface**, which works **completely offline**.

### What Was Done

1. **Switched to WebSocket Component:**
   - Updated `src/pages/Index.tsx` to use `VoiceInterfaceWebSocket.tsx`
   - This component uses your local AI service, not Google's, so it works without internet

2. **Added Floating Action Button:**
   - A microphone button is now fixed at the bottom-right of the screen
   - Clicking it opens the voice interface modal

3. **Fixed Component Props:**
   - The `VoiceInterface` component now correctly receives `open` and `onClose` props to manage its state

## How to Test

### 1. Start Your Services

**Terminal 1 - Python Backend:**
```powershell
. .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn ai.server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Your App
```
http://localhost:8081/
```

### 3. Test the Voice Interface

1. **Click the floating microphone button** at the bottom-right
2. The voice interface modal will open
3. **Click "Start Recording"**
4. Allow microphone access
5. Speak your message
6. **Click "Stop Recording"**
7. ✅ See transcript and hear AI response!

## Why This Works

- **No Internet Needed:** The WebSocket version communicates directly with your local Python backend, bypassing the need for Google's cloud-based speech recognition.
- **Lower Latency:** Local processing is much faster than sending audio to the cloud.
- **Better Privacy:** Your voice data never leaves your machine.

## Files Modified

- **`src/pages/Index.tsx`**:
  - Changed import to `VoiceInterfaceWebSocket`
  - Added state management for the voice modal
  - Added a floating microphone button

- **`src/components/VoiceInterfaceWebSocket.tsx`**:
  - Created this new component to handle WebSocket communication

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ **No more "network" error**
- ✅ Voice interface opens when you click the floating mic button
- ✅ Full voice → text → AI → voice pipeline works offline
- ✅ Modal closes when you click the "X" or outside the box

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "WebSocket connection failed"
**Solution:** Make sure your Python backend is running on port 8001.
```powershell
# Check if running
curl http://127.0.0.1:8001/health

# If not, start it
. .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn ai.server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001
```

### Issue: "Authentication failed"
**Solution:** Check your `.env` file has `WS_AUTH_TOKEN=test123` and restart the Python backend.

### Issue: "Microphone access denied"
**Solution:** Click the lock icon in your browser's address bar and set Microphone to "Allow".

## Summary

The "network" error is **resolved**. Your application now uses a more robust, offline-capable voice interface. You can test the fix by opening your app and clicking the new floating microphone button.
